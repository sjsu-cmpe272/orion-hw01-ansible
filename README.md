# Ansible Demo in Cisco dCloud

This demo has the files needed to configure ansible server on ubuntu and deploys a webserver on centos1 and centos2, and brings it up on port 8080 with a web page that is accessible on from the Windows 10 Workstation, wkst1, that displays the message: “Hello World print from CentosX.” (Where X is 1 or 2 depending on the server)
